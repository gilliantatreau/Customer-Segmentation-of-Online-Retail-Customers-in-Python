# Customer Segmentation of Online Retail Customers
k-means clustering and word clouds for online retail transaction data.

All retailers wish to increase their profits, and therefore, their sales. Online retailers have the opportunity to reach a larger customer base because they are not limited to the individuals that are able to physically visit the store; therefore, understanding customer characteristics and transaction patterns within their virtual storefront is even more crucial in developing effective marketing strategies as well as allocating resources where they are most needed. In order to increase their sales, a retailer must first understand what their current customers are buying and what sales patterns exist within their own order history data. These sales patterns might include insight into their most-sold products, the geographic region that their customers are buying from, and what products are bringing in the most profit. ![image](https://github.com/gilliantatreau/Customer-Segmentation-of-Online-Retail-Customers-in-Python/assets/155679012/b77c3f89-d000-4dcc-bc0b-37b97f6b34ce)

Customer segmentation is the division of all customers into groups that share similar characteristics. Each group can be described by a persona or profile that is then used by marketing teams to best appeal to that customer segment. ![image](https://github.com/gilliantatreau/Customer-Segmentation-of-Online-Retail-Customers-in-Python/assets/155679012/88e28677-45fa-42d3-b594-02da319cd8d7)
